## Note: 

There is a diagram from problem 6 under /src/problem6/infra.png

This is my first time doing blockchain programming and deploying a smart contract using Solidity. The contract for question 5 has been deployed to Sepolia testnet. Overall, the code challenging was challenging but fun. Thank you for the experience!
